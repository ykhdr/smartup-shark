This game allows you to dive into the underwater world
and experience the life of a dangerous shark.
You will have to survive in this harsh world among thousands of predators

The shark is controlled by the cursor.
You can eat fish with a blue outline.
Each fish you eat gives you a point and makes your shark bigger.
The bigger your shark is, the more blue-rimmed fish you will encounter.
Beware of jellyfish, you can't eat them!
